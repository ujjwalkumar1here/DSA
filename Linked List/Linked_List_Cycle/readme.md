# Linked List Cycle

Approach

Step 1

If the linked list is empty or contains only one node, return false.

Step 2

Initialize two pointers:
- slow = head
- fast = head

Step 3

Traverse the linked list while:
- fast != NULL
- fast->next != NULL

Step 4

Move the slow pointer one step forward.

slow = slow->next

Step 5

Move the fast pointer two steps forward.

fast = fast->next->next

Step 6

After moving both pointers, check if slow == fast.

If they meet, a cycle exists. Return true.

Step 7

If the loop ends, the fast pointer has reached the end of the linked list, so no cycle exists.

Return false.

Logic

The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time.

If there is no cycle, the fast pointer reaches NULL.

If there is a cycle, the fast pointer eventually catches the slow pointer because it is moving faster.

Dry Run

Input

3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4
     ^         |
     |_________|

Initial

slow = 3
fast = 3

Iteration 1

slow = 2
fast = 0

Iteration 2

slow = 0
fast = 2

Iteration 3

slow = -4
fast = -4

slow == fast

Return true.

Example (No Cycle)

Input

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL

Initial

slow = 1
fast = 1

Iteration 1

slow = 2
fast = 3

Next Iteration

fast->next = NULL

Loop Ends

Return false.

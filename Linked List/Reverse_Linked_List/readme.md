# Reverse Linked List

Approach

Step 1

Initialize two pointers:
- temp = head
- prev = NULL

Step 2

Traverse the linked list until head becomes NULL.

Step 3

Store the next node by moving head to head->next.

Step 4

Reverse the current node's link by pointing temp->next to prev.

Step 5

Move prev to the current node.

Step 6

Move temp to the next node.

Step 7

Repeat the process until all links are reversed.

Step 8

Return prev because it points to the new head of the reversed linked list.

Logic

At every iteration:

1. Move head to the next node.
2. Reverse the current node's pointer.
3. Move prev one step forward.
4. Move temp one step forward.

The pointers move as follows:

head = head->next
temp->next = prev
prev = temp
temp = head

Dry Run

Input

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL

Initial

prev = NULL
temp = 1
head = 1

Iteration 1

head = 2

1 -> NULL

prev = 1
temp = 2

Iteration 2

head = 3

2 -> 1 -> NULL

prev = 2
temp = 3

Iteration 3

head = NULL

3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL

prev = 3

Loop Ends

Return prev.

Output

3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL

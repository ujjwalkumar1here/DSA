# Merge Two Sorted Lists

Approach

Step 1

Create a dummy node and a tail pointer.

dummy = new ListNode(-1)
tail = dummy

Step 2

Traverse both linked lists while both pointers are not NULL.

Step 3

Compare the values of the current nodes.

If list1->val <= list2->val

Attach list1 to the merged list and move list1 one step forward.

Otherwise,

Attach list2 to the merged list and move list2 one step forward.

Step 4

Move the tail pointer one step forward after every insertion.

Step 5

When one linked list becomes empty, attach the remaining nodes of the other linked list.

Step 6

Return dummy->next because the dummy node is not part of the final merged list.

Logic

A dummy node is used to avoid handling the first node separately.

The tail pointer always points to the last node of the merged linked list.

At every iteration, compare the current nodes of both lists and attach the smaller node to the merged list.

After one list is exhausted, directly attach the remaining part of the other list because it is already sorted.

Dry Run

Input

List1

1 -> 2 -> 4

List2

1 -> 3 -> 4

Initial

dummy -> NULL

tail = dummy

Iteration 1

Compare 1 and 1

Attach List1 node.

Merged List

1

tail = 1

Iteration 2

Compare 2 and 1

Attach List2 node.

Merged List

1 -> 1

tail = second 1

Iteration 3

Compare 2 and 3

Attach List1 node.

Merged List

1 -> 1 -> 2

tail = 2

Iteration 4

Compare 4 and 3

Attach List2 node.

Merged List

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

tail = 3

Iteration 5

Compare 4 and 4

Attach List1 node.

Merged List

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

tail = first 4

List1 becomes NULL.

Attach the remaining node of List2.

Final Output

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

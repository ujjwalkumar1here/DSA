# Middle of the Linked List

Approach

Step 1

Initialize two pointers:
- slow = head
- fast = head

Step 2

Traverse the linked list while:
- fast != NULL
- fast->next != NULL

Step 3

Move the slow pointer one step forward.

slow = slow->next

Step 4

Move the fast pointer two steps forward.

fast = fast->next->next

Step 5

Repeat the process until the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list.

Step 6

When the loop ends, the slow pointer will be pointing to the middle node.

Step 7

Return the slow pointer.

Logic

The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time.

When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, the slow pointer has covered only half the distance and therefore points to the middle node.

If the linked list has an even number of nodes, the algorithm automatically returns the second middle node.

Dry Run

Input

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Initial

slow = 1
fast = 1

Iteration 1

slow = 2
fast = 3

Iteration 2

slow = 3
fast = 5

Iteration 3

fast->next = NULL

Loop Ends

Return slow.

Output

3 -> 4 -> 5

Example (Even Length)

Input

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Initial

slow = 1
fast = 1

Iteration 1

slow = 2
fast = 3

Iteration 2

slow = 3
fast = 5

Iteration 3

slow = 4
fast = NULL

Loop Ends

Return slow.

Output

4 -> 5 -> 6
